# chan Sankaku adblocker

Here I am making random scripts for https:// chan.sankakucomplex.com because I have nothing better to do. It mainly consists of a script to stop the stupid message:

"You have been flagged as using Ad-block, or scripts that meddle with the Ad-block detection methods in place. To continue using the site regularly, disable them, or upgrade to Sankaku Plus! "

**How to use:**

make sure to have [TamperMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) installed
create a new TamperMonkey script  
copy & paste my script onto the editor and save it.
Done!

so far, I have two scripts, both updated to function without any bugs, but if you do encounter anything, please let me know
